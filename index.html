<h4>Yourtasks:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
	Loop over the 'dogs' array containing dog objects,and for each dog,calculate the recommended food portion and add it to the object as a new property.Do not create a new array, simply loop over the array.Forumla:
      recommended Food=weight**0.75*28.</li>
	<li>Find Sarah's dog and log to the console whether it's eating too much or too little .Hint:Some dogs have multiple owners,  so you first need to find Sarah in the owners array,and so this one is a bit tricky(on purpose)</li>
  <li>Create an array containing all owners of dogs who eat too much
('ownersEatTooMuch') and an array with all owners of dogs who eat too little('ownersEatTooLittle').</li>
<li>Log a string to the console for each array created in 3.,like this: "Matilda and Alice and Bob's dogs eat too much!" and "Sarah and John and Michael's dogs eat too little!"</li>
<li>Log to the console whether there is any dog eating exactly the amount of food that is recommended (Just true or false)</li>	
<li>Log to the console whether there is any dog eating an okay amount of food(Just true or false)</li>
<li>Create an array containing the dogs that are eating an okay amount of food (try to reuse the condition used in 6.)</li>
<li>Create a shallow copy of the 'dogs' array and sort it by recommended food portion in an ascending order(keep in mind that the portions are inside the array's objects)
</li>
